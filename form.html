                        <h3>The following sectors are available:</h4>

                           <h4>Mechanical engineering:</h4>
                           <p>Includes companies whose activities extend to the development, construction and production of machines and systems. The “mechanical engineering” sector also includes the sub-sectors “special mechanical engineering” and “machine tool engineering” that can be selected. </p>

                           <h4> Special mechanical engineering : </h4>
                           <p>Subset of the mechanical engineering industry. The focus in special machine construction is on the development and construction of individual pieces or small series specifically according to customer requirements.</p>

                           <h4>Machine tool construction :</h4>
                           <p>Also a subset of the mechanical engineering industry. Companies in this category usually specialize in the design and production of machines that are used to produce workpieces using tools. What is characteristic is that the movement of these two components relative to one another is dictated by the machine. The most important representatives include turning and milling machines, eroding machines and mechanical presses.</p>

                           <h4>Automotive :</h4>
                           <p>Comprises companies in the automotive industry whose activities are predominantly related to the development, design and production of automobiles. Here the focus is on the supplier industry. Classic automobile manufacturers are not part of the consideration set.</p>

                           <h4>Trade : </h4>
                           <p>Companies whose activities primarily involve the purchase and distribution of goods, assets and services. The “Trade” sector includes both wholesale and retail and also includes the sub-sectors “E-Commerce” and “Stationary Retail” that can be selected. </p>

                           <h4>E commerce :</h4>
                           <p>Companies in the (retail) trade sector that carry out purchasing and sales primarily online.</p>

                           <h4>Stationary retail :</h4>
                           <p>Here too, the focus of the peer group is on retail. In this case, stationary retail. Classic branch lists are listed.</p>

                           <h4>Manufacturing industry : </h4>
                           <p>This is the comparison group for industrial companies that “produce” themselves – in small or large quantities. A conscious differentiation between products does not yet take place at this level.</p>

                           In general, a company with a higher level of added value generally also needs more of its own human capital or more and better qualified workers. The two parameters personnel expenses and gross profit are therefore inevitably linked to one another. One could also say that the gross profit ratio represents a limiting condition for personnel costs.
                           It can be proven mathematically/statistically that companies that deviate from a certain ratio (gross profit to personnel costs) are less likely to achieve a positive overall result. We call the path of this relation the performance corridor. To put it simply, you can also say that the performance corridor evaluates how much you have to pay your staff in order to generate a EURO gross profit.

                           As a profitability indicator, ROCE describes how high the return on capital employed is. It therefore reflects the ratio of EBIT to capital stock and thus takes capital performance into account in addition to operational performance.Against this background, ROCE reflects all relevant parameters of a business model and thus allows a “fair and objective” assessment of performance in comparison with business model peers using: <br> Capital employed = fixed assets + working capital
